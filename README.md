# Business Landing Page

This is a simple business landing page template built in HTML and intended for educational purposes. Students can use this template to practice and apply CSS styling to create a visually appealing landing page.

## Files Included

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file for the landing page. It provides the structure and content placeholders.

- **styles.css**: An empty CSS file is included for students to add their own styles and design elements to the landing page.

## Getting Started

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the basic structure of the landing page.

2. Open the `styles.css` file and add your custom CSS styles to enhance the design of the landing page.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the HTML and CSS files to meet your specific needs. You can change the text, add images, modify the layout, and more by editing the HTML file and applying styles in the CSS file.
